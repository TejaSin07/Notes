Monolithic Architecture:
=======================

==> Developing all functionalities in single application

1) presentation layer
2) Business layer
3) Data Access layer

=> Drawbacks With Monolithic server

1) Burden on server
2) Response Delay
3) server can crash
4) single point of failure
5) technology dependant

==> To overcome problems of monolith Architecture ,people are using Microservices Architecture.

Microservices
==============

=> It is not a technology
=> It is not a framework
=> It is not an API
=> it is architectural design pattern
=> it is universal and anyone can use this architecture to develop application.


NOTE: Divide & Conquer principle

==============================
Advantages  with Microservices
==============================

1) loosely Coupled
2) Burden Reduced on servers
3) Easy Maintenance
4) No single point of failure
5) Technology Independent
6) Quick Delivery

=============================
Challenges with Microservices
=============================

1) Bounded Context
2) Repeated configuration
3) Visibility  

=> Identifying how many microservices we need to develop  for one application and deciding which functionality we need to add in which microservice.
=> In several microservices we need to write some configurations like data source ,smtp ,kafka ,redis etc....
=> In microservice architecture we might not get chance to work with all APIs in the application.

============================
Microservices Architecture :
============================

1) service registry(Eureka)
2) Admin server 
3) Zipkin server
4) Config Server
5) Kafka server
6) Redis Server
7) API Gateway
8) Interservice communication

=================
Service Registry:
=================

=> service registry is used to maintain all apis information like name ,status ,url and health at one place.
=> It is also called as Service Discovery.
=> we can use eureka server as service registry.
=> It will provide user interface to get apis info.

----------------------

=============
Admin Server
=============

=> It is used to monitor and manage all the apis at one place/

=> It provide beautiful user interface to access all apis actuator endpoint at one place.


=============
Zipkin Server
=============

=> It isa used for distributed tracing of our request
=> It provide beautiful user interface to access apis execution details.
=> Run below query in cmd for execution:
   C:\Users\tejas\Desktop\springboot repo\jar zipkin>java -jar zipkin-server-3.5.0-exec.jar											

=============
Config Server
=============

=> It is used to separate application code and application properties.
=> It is used to externalise config props of our application.
=> It makes our application  loosely coupled with properties file or yml file.

===========
FeignClient
===========

=> It is used for interservice communication
=> If one api communicate with another api with in the same application 
   then it is called as Inter Service communication


============
Kafka Server (earlier we use RabitMQ )
============

=> It used as message broker
=> Distributed streaming platform
=> It works on pub-sub model


=============
Redis Server
=============

=> Redis is a cache server.
=> Redis represent data in key-value format.
=> Redis is used to reduce no.of db calls.

===========
API Gateway
===========

=> It acts  as entry point for all backend APIs.
=> It acts as mediator between frontend and backend APIs.
=> In API Gateway we will writer filters and Routings
	Filter: We can perform pre-process & post-Process.
	Routings: To forward request to particular backend-APIs. 

ref diagram for application :

=>  43 application
	8761--> give port number this ,to register all apis with eureka

=> 44 application
	for admin server  add dependency of codecetric 
	

=> Installation of zipkin server is in video(we to download jar execute using cmd)

=> 45 application

=> 46 application
