Debugging 
==========

Main Navigation Keys:
---------------------

1) F5 (Step Into) → goes inside the method you’re calling (even JDK/Spring internals).

2) F6 (Step Over) → executes the current line but doesn’t go inside it.

3) F7 (Step Return / Step Out) → finishes the current method and brings you back to the caller.

4) F8 (Resume) → continues execution until the next breakpoint.

- Accidentally stepped into framework? → F7 (Step Return).

- Don’t want to step in? → F6 (Step Over).

- Lost deep inside? → F8 to skip to next breakpoint.

- Want to manually return? → Use Debug View stack frames and click your method.

- Once you’re at the return line and  already know what’s coming back.

  There’s no need to press F6. Just F8 to continue → execution will naturally return to your controller, and if you have a breakpoint there, it will stop.



Note :
1) If you don’t see Variables View:

  - Go to menu → Window → Show View → Variables.
 
  - Same for Expressions View.

2) If you want to examine multiple places in one request:

  - Set breakpoints at A, B, C.

  - Then use F8 to jump through them in order.

  - If you only care about one spot (say A), remove others, otherwise you’ll keep stopping everywhere.
  
  - you can see all breakpoint in breakpoint view**
