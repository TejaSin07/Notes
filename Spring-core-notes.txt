spring boot is extension for spring

====================
Project development
===================

=> Project means collection of classes

=> In a project we can see below types of classes

1) POJO classes (DTO / VO / Binding / Command) : To represent data

What is a POJO Class?

A POJO (Plain Old Java Object) is a simple Java class that follows basic object-oriented principles without relying on any special restrictions, frameworks, or annotations.

Characteristics of a POJO Class
✔ Encapsulation – Uses private fields with public getters/setters
✔ No Business Logic – It only holds data
✔ No Special Annotations – Unlike JavaBeans or JPA Entities
✔ Serializable (Optional) – Can implement Serializable if needed

2) Component Classes (controller/service/dao/util) : logic

		Controller --> logic to handle req & resp

		Service --> business logic (validation, otp, reports)

		DAO --> logic to communicate with DB

		Utils --> email ops, pwd ops, date ops...


=================================================================
How one java class method can access another java class method ?	
=================================================================

1) Inheritance (IS-A)

2) Composition (HAS-A)

Note: With IS-A and HAS-A our classes will become tightly coupled.

=> To overcome this tightly coupling we need to develop our classes with strategy design pattern (GOF).

1) Favour composition over inheritance

2) Code with interfaces

3) Code should be open for extension


===============================
What is dependency injection ?
===============================

=> The process of injecting dependent obj into target obj is called as dependency injection (DI).

=> We can perform this DI in 3 ways

	1) Field Injection
	2) Setter Injection
	3) Constructor Injection

=> Injecting dependent obj into target class variable directly is called as FI.	
=> Injecting dependent obj into target class obj using target class constructor is called as CI.
=> Injecting dependent obj into target class obj using target class setter method is called as SI.

Note: In normal java apps, programmers are responsible to perform DI.
Note: If we use spring core then IOC container will take care of Dependency Injection.

================
What is IOC ?
================

=> Inversion of control
=> IOC is a principle which is responsible to manage and collaborate dependencies among the objects in the application.
=> IOC will take care of Dependency Injection.



1) What is IOC container

2) How many ways we can start IOC

3) Dependency Injection

4) How many ways are there for DI

5) What is CI

6) What is SI

7) What is FI

8) What is Spring Bean ?

9) what is  pom.xml?

Project object model, inside that dependencies are available.and using that maven will download required jar files.


10) why we are using private variable for object storing variable?

11) UserService service = ctx.getBean(UserService.class); this is line from 04_IOC_APP : 
we have not created object of interface in ioc,then how we are able to get bean for that?

12) note: in xml configuration i.e spring we have only two DI ,field injection not directly possible .
===============
STS IDE Setup
===============

=> Download sts ide jar using below link

https://cdn.spring.io/spring-tools/release/STS4/4.21.1.RELEASE/dist/e4.30/spring-tool-suite-4-4.21.1.RELEASE-e4.30.0-win32.win32.x86_64.self-extracting.jar

=> Extract jar file using below command

		java -jar <jar-file-name>

=> Go to STS folder and open IDE using .exe file		

===================================
First app development using spring
===================================

1) Create Maven project (Simple) using IDE (Eclipse/STS/IntelliJ)

2) Add 'spring-context' dependency in project pom.xml file

		URL : www.mvnrepository.com

3) Create Required java classes using strategy design pattern

4) Create Spring Beans Configuration file

5) Create Test class to test our app with IOC container





------------------------------------------------------------
<property /> : Represents setter injection

<constructor-arg /> : Represents constructor injection
------------------------------------------------------------

============
Bean Scopes
============

=> Scope will decide when to create obj for spring bean and how many objects should be created for spring bean.

=> We have 4 types of scopes in spring

		1) singleton (default)
		2) prototype
		3) request --> A new bean instance is created for each HTTP request and is discarded after the request completes.
		4) session --> A new bean instance is created for each HTTP session and shared across multiple requests from the same session.

=> Singleton means only one object will be created 
		(at the time of ioc startup)		

=> Prototype means every time new object will be created when we call getBean() method.
	<bean id="eng" class="in.ashokit.Engine" scope="prototype" />

=> if we make scope prototype then every time object created for every request.

Note: request and session scopes are used in spring web mvc module.


Note: IOC will perform Eager loading for singleton beans and it will perform lazy loading for prototype beans.

=================
Bean life cycle
=================

Thread Life Cycle  : will be managed by thread schedular

Servlets Life Cycle : will be managed by Servlet Container

Spring Bean Life Cycle : will be managed by IOC container


init-method : After bean obj creation ,when we want to execute logic at start.

destory-method : When ioc is closed  . if any logic we want to execute while closing we can write here. 

<bean id="eng" class="in.ashokit.Engine"
				init-method="m1"
				destory-method="m2" />

----------------------------------------------------------------

============
Autowiring  (for spring we do autowiring by using xml file only)
============

If we perform DI using property or constructor-arg tags then it is called as Manual wiring.

We will use ref attribute to specify dependent bean
	Ex: <property name="eng" ref="de"/>


-----------------------------

1) Manual wiring (programmer should specify what is dependent)

2) Auto wiring	(IOC will identify dependent bean obj)

=> TO use Autowiring configuration changes are required

=> we have Autowiring modes

		1) byName (identify dependent based on bean name)  -> we will give same name to bean, which we are giving to parameter who receiving bean object 

		2) byType (identify dependent based on bean type)
		
		3) constructor
		
		4) none (default)

Collection Injection
======================

public class Student {
	
	private Integer id;

	private String name;

	private List courses;

	private Set hobbies;

}


java.lang.Object ====> default super class

public String toString(){
	
 return	this.getClass().getName()+"@"+
 		Integer.toHexString(this.hashCode());
}
