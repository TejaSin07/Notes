1) What is a programming language

2) What is Technology

3) What is Framework


=======================
Programming Language
=======================

=> Language is a medium to communicate

		1) Human Languages

			Ex: English, Hindi, Telugu

		2) Programming Languages

			Ex: C, C++, Java, Python, C#


=> Programming Languages are used to communicate with Computer	

=> Every P.L contains set of syntaxes and rules		

=> Using P.L we can develop software applications

Note: Java is a programming language.



======================
Software Technologies
======================

-> Technologies are developed based on programming languages only

	Ex: Servlets, JSP

-> Technogies are used to develop different types of applications

-> We need to write duplicate code in project at several places

	Ex :

		1) get connection
		2) create stmt
		3) execute query
		4) process results

		5) capture form data
		6) validate form data
		7) convert form data to DTO obj


100 Database tables

100 DAO classes

In every DAO we have 10 methods

100 * 10 => 1000 methods


2 Types of logics

		1) Common Logics  

		2) Business Logics 


	Challenges : 

			1) Duplicate Code (Boiler Plate Code)
			2) More lines of code
			3) More  Exceptions
			4) Maintenance		

==============
Frameworks		
==============

-> It is a piece of software (semi developed software)
-> Framework provides common logics required for application development
-> Using frameworks we can develop applications quickly
-> If we are using frameworks then we need to focus only on  business logics.
		
		1) no duplicate code
		2) faster development
		3) less lines of code
		4) less no of bugs
		5) easy maintenance

Session - 03 (06-Nov)
######################

==========================
Layered Architecture
=========================

1) Presentation Layer   : User interface

	Technologies : JSP / Angular / React / Vue JS

2) Web Layer : Controllers (Handles request & response)

	Technologies : Servlets / Struts framework	

3) Business Layer : Services (business logic)


4) Persistence Layer : DAO classes (DB communication)

		Technologies : JDBC / Hibernate framework

=============================
What is Spring Framework ?
=============================

-> Spring is an application development framework

-> Spring provides support for end to end application development

-> Spring is java based framework

-> Spring is free of cost

-> Spring released in the year of 2004 (1.x)

-> The current  version of spring is 6.x (2022)

=====================
Spring Architecture
=====================

-> Spring framework developed in modular fashion

-> Spring Modules are loosely coupled (independent)

-> We have several modules in spring framework like below


Spring Core → Provides the core features of the Spring Framework like IoC (Inversion of Control) and Dependency Injection.

Spring Context → Provides a way to access objects in the Spring container, supports internationalization, event handling, resource loading.

Spring AOP → Enables Aspect-Oriented Programming (logging, transactions, security) without changing business logic.

Spring JDBC / Spring DAO → Simplifies database access by reducing boilerplate JDBC code and handling exceptions.

Spring ORM → Integrates with ORM frameworks (Hibernate, JPA, etc.) for easier database operations.

Spring Web MVC → Builds web applications using the Model-View-Controller pattern.

Spring REST → Provides RESTful web services development support using annotations.

Spring Security → Handles authentication, authorization, and protection against security threats (like CSRF, XSS).

Spring Batch → Handles batch processing jobs (like reading/writing large data, scheduled jobs, ETL).

Spring Cloud → Supports building distributed systems and microservices (service discovery, configuration, load balancing).

Spring Data → Simplifies data access with repositories and reduces boilerplate for working with databases (JPA, MongoDB, etc.)

Note: We can use any module based on our project requirement.

===========
Spring Core
===========

-> It is base module in the spring framework

-> It is providing fundamental concepts of spring

		1) IOC Container
		2) Dependency Injection
		3) Auto wiring

Note: Using spring core we can develop application classes with loosely coupling.

================
Spring Context
================

-> It is responsible for managing configurations in the application.

.Creates all beans

.Injects dependencies

.Manages lifecycle

.Loads properties

Supports event handling (e.g., after saving, trigger a confirmation email)

==============
Spring AOP
==============

AOP : Aspect Oriented Programming

=> AOP is used to separate primary logics and secondary logics in the application.

		Primary Logic : Business logic

			Ex: amt-deposit, amt-withdraw, balance check

		Secondary logic : cross-cutting logics (helper logics)

			Ex: security, tx, logging, auditing etc...

===================
Spring JDBC/ DAO
===================

-> It is used to develop persistence layer in the application.

-> Using Spring JDBC we can avoid boiler plate code.

		Register Driver : Spring jdbc will handle
		Get connection : Spring jdbc will handle
		Create Stmt : Spring jdbc will handle
		execute query  : Programmer should handle
		process result : spring jdbc will handle
		close connection : spring jdbc will handle


Note: Spring JDBC module internally will communicate with JDBC API.

===========
Spring ORM 
============

=> ORM stands for Object Relational Mapping

=> ORM will represent data in the form of Objects

=> Hibernate is called as ORM framework

=> Hibernate is used to develop persistence layer

=> Spring ORM developed on top of Hibernate.

=> Using Spring ORM we can avoid boiler plate code in DAO layer.


================
Spring Web MVC
================

=> It is used to develop web application with MVC architecture

=> It supports web layer + presentation layer development.

=> It is used to develop C2B applications

		(Customer to business)

=> It supports multiple presentation technologies

			1) JSP
			2) Thymeleaf


=============
Spring REST
=============

=> It is used to develop distributed applications (B2B)

=> One app can communicate with another application


	passport <===========>  aadhar app

	makeymytrip <===========> irctc

	gpay <============> bank app

================
Spring Security
================

=> We can secure our application using Spring Security


1) Authentication : Who can access our app

2) Authorization : Role Based Access

=============
Spring Batch
=============

=> Batch operation means bulk operation

=> To implement bulk operations we will use spring batch


1) sending bulk sms to all students
2) generate bank stmt for all account holders
3) send credit bill for all card holder

==============
Spring Cloud
==============

=> It is used to implement microservices


1) Service Registry
2) API Gateway
3) FeignClient
4) Circuit Breaker etc...




1) What is Framework

2) Advantages with framework

3) Struts Framework

4) Hibernate Framework

5) Layered Architecture

6) Spring Framework

7) Spring Architecture

8) Spring Modules


=> Project contains multiple classes

		a) Controllers : To handle req & res

		b) Services : Business logic

		c) DAOs : Persistence logic


=> Controller class methods should call service class methods

		(controllers are dependent on services)	


=> service class methods should call DAO class methods

		(services are dependent on DAOs)

================================================================
How one java class method can access another java class method	
================================================================

1) By Inheritance (IS-A)

2) By Composition (HAS-A)	

===============
IS-A Relation
================

public class Engine {
	
	public int start() {
		System.out.println("Engine Starting...");
		return 1;
	}

}

public class Car extends Engine {

	public void drive() {
		int status = super.start();

		if (status >= 1) {
			System.out.println("Journey Started...");
		} else {
			System.out.println("Failed to start the engine...");
		}
	}
}

==================
HAS-A relation
==================

public class Car  {
	public void drive() {
		
		Engine eng = new Engine();
		int status = eng.start();
		
		if (status >= 1) {
			System.out.println("Journey Started...");
		} else {
			System.out.println("Failed to start the engine...");
		}
	}
}

=============
Conclusion
=============

=> With IS-A & HAS-A relation our classes are tightly coupled.

=> Developing classes with tightly coupling not recommended.

=> Always we need to develop our classes with loosely coupling.

=> To develop classes with loosely coupling we will use Spring Core module.


EXAMPLE :

IPayment.java
-------------

package kilo;

public interface IPayment {
	
	public boolean payBill(double amt);

}

DebitCardPayment.java
---------------------
package kilo;

public class DebitCardPayment implements IPayment{
		public boolean payBill(double amt) {
			System.out.println("debited payment processing....");
			return true;
		}
}

CreditCardPayment
------------------
package kilo;

public class CreditCardPayment implements IPayment{
	public boolean payBill(double amt) {
		System.out.println("credit-card payment processing...");
		return true;
	}
}

RestairantService.java
----------------------
package kilo;

public class RestaurantService {
	
	IPayment payment;//it can hold any implementing class object
	//first when object is created value is null for payment, after DI CI FI value is assigned to it
	
//	public RestaurantService(IPayment payment) {
//		this.payment=payment;
//	}
//	public void setPayment(IPayment payment) {
//		this.payment=payment;
//	}
	public void collectBill(double amt) {
		boolean status = payment.payBill(amt);
		if(status) {
			System.out.println("payment success...thank you...");
		}else {
			System.out.println("Card declined");
		}
	}
}

Test.java
----------
package kilo;

public class Test {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
//		RestaurantService service = new RestaurantService(new CreditCardPayment());//CI
		RestaurantService service = new RestaurantService(); 
		service.payment = new CreditCardPayment();	     //FI
//		service.setPayment(new CreditCardPayment());         //SI
		service.collectBill(1323.90);
	}

}


=============
Spring Core
==============

-> It is base module in spring framework

-> Core module providing fundamental concepts of spring

		1) IOC container (IOC)
		2) Dependency Injection (DI)
		4) Auto wiring 

=> By  using spring core concepts we can develop classes with loosely coupling.
=> If we want our classes to be managed by IOC then we need to develop our classes with some rules.

=======================
Strategy Design Pattern
=======================

1) Favour composition over inheritance
2) Code with Interfaces instead of implementation classes
3) Code should be open for extension and closed for modification

1️⃣ Constructor Injection

Dependency is passed through the constructor.
Defined in XML using <constructor-arg>.
Ensures the dependency is available when the object is created (best for mandatory dependencies).

<bean id="userService" class="in.ashokit.service.UserServiceImpl">
    <constructor-arg ref="userDao" />
</bean>


✅ Pros: Immutable, good for required dependencies, easy to test.
❌ Cons: Less flexible if too many dependencies.

2️⃣ Setter Injection

Dependency is injected through a setter method.
Defined in XML using <property>.
Spring first creates the object, then calls the setter to inject the dependency.

<bean id="userService" class="in.ashokit.service.UserServiceImpl">
    <property name="userDao" ref="userDao2" />
</bean>

✅ Pros: More flexible, can inject optional dependencies.
❌ Cons: Object can exist without complete initialization.

Spring will look for:

public void setUserDao(IUserDao userDao)

✔️ Correct → follows naming convention
❌ Wrong → setuserDao, SetUserDao, setUserdao, or setDao

Setter Naming Convention
=========================

The method must start with set.
The next letter of the property name must be capitalized.
The rest of the property name stays the same.
The method must take exactly one parameter — the type of the property being injected.
The method must be public.

3️⃣ Field Injection

Dependency is injected directly into a private field using @Autowired.
Requires <context:annotation-config/> in XML.

@Autowired
private IUserDao userDao;

<context:annotation-config/>
<bean id="userDao" class="in.ashokit.dao.UserDaoImpl"/>
<bean id="userService" class="in.ashokit.service.UserServiceImpl"/>

✅ Pros: Less boilerplate, quick setup.
❌ Cons: Harder to test, hides dependencies, not ideal for clean architecture.

========================
Constructor Injection
========================

=> Inject one class object into another class obj using constructor.

	Ex : Car c = new Car(new PetrolEng());

a parameterized constructor is necessary for constructor injection in Spring. Here's why:

Definition of Constructor Injection: Constructor injection is a technique where Spring injects dependencies 
into a class via its constructor. For this to work, the class must have a constructor that accepts parameters 
corresponding to the dependencies.

(dependencies are the objects that a class relies on for its behavior.)

How Spring Determines Dependencies: Spring uses the parameterized constructor to determine which beans or values 
to inject. If your class does not have a parameterized constructor, there is no mechanism for Spring to know where 
to inject the dependencies.


========================
setter Injection
========================

=> Injecting one class object into another class object using setter method 
=> we user property tag to perform SI in spring xml

		Ex:   Car c = new Car();
			 c.setEng(new DieselEng());

Q) If we perform both CI & SI then what will happen ?

Ans) 

CI will happen first at the time of obj creation

After CI, SI will happen

SI will override CI

So the final value will be SI injected value/obj.

============================================
why field injection not possible in spring ?
============================================

XML dependency injection can’t do field injection because it’s built on the JavaBean model, which only supports constructor and setter-based injection — not direct field access.
Field injection became possible later using annotations and reflection, not XML tags.

=====================
Dependency Injection
=====================

=> The process of injecting dependent object into target object is called as dependency injection.
NOTE : In normal java application programmer are responsible to perform DI.

		
		Car is dependent on Engine

		Controller is dependent on Service

		Service is dependent on DAO

=> We can perform Dependency Injection in 3 ways

		1) Constructor Injection
		2) Setter Injection
		3) Field Injection		


Requirement: Develop BillPayment application using Strategy Design Pattern.

	1) Cash  (device not required)
	2) Scanner
	3) Debit Card
	4) Credit Card

=====================================
IOC Container (Inversion Of Control)
=====================================

=> IOC is a "principle" which is responsible to manage and collaborate dependencies among the objects in the application 
"or"
Inversion of Control means handing over the responsibility of controlling the program’s flow or object management to a framework or external system.

=> IOC will take care of Dependency Injection

=> It will create dependent object and target object and then it will inject dependent obj into target object.

====================
What is Spring Bean
====================

=> The java classes which are managed by IOC are called as Spring Bean classes.



=========
Maven
=========

=> Maven is a build tool for java applications

=> Maven developed by Apache Org

=> Maven s/w developed by using Java language

=> Maven is free & OSS

=> Using Maven we can create both stand-alone & web apps.


#### Maven Setup  :: https://youtu.be/hV1OWzYpzxo?si=jD7vz3oJeRVclTxF

###########  Note: Alternate for maven is Gradle. ##############

### Gradle Tutorial : https://youtu.be/I84f9Q5bFBA?si=8qs3Ue7N_E0bBQco

========================
Creating Maven Project
========================

-> We can create maven project using CLI & IDE

-> Select File -> New -> Maven Project

			- Select simple project (stand-alone)
			- groupId : in.ashokit
			- artifactId : 01-Spring-IOC-App
			- packaging : jar
			- Click on Finish


=> Once project created we can see below folder structure

		- src/main/java  (source code we will keep here)
		- src/main/resources  (config files we will keep here)
		- src/test/java (junit classes for unit testing)
		- src/test/resources (junit related config files)
		- target (.class files will be stored here)
		- Maven Dependencies (downloaded jars/dependencies)
		- pom.xml (maven config file)

=> We can search for maven dependencies using www.mvnrepository.com

=> in xml ,property is variable

Manual Injection:
=================

1) <bean id="userService" class="in.ashokit.service.UserServiceImpl">
    <constructor-arg ref="userDao" />                       <- constructor injection 
   </bean>

2) <bean id="userService" class="in.ashokit.service.UserServiceImpl">
    <property name="userDao" ref="userDao" />                <- setter injection
  </bean>


=============
Bean Scopes
=============

=> Bean Scope will decide how many objects should be created for spring bean class.

=> We have 4 types of scopes

		1) singleton   (by default)
		2) Prototype  → new bean each time you call getBean().
		3) request
		4) session


-> For singleton scoped beans only one object will be created by IOC container at the time of IOC starting (eager loading).

-> For prototype scoped beans IOC will create new object every time based on demand (lazy loading).(when we use getBean)


-> To configure bean scope we will use "scope" attribute.

	<bean id="credit" class="in.ashokit.CreditCardPayment" 
					  scope="prototype" />

NOTE: For prototype beans, Spring does not manage the lifecycle beyond the creation of the bean. As a result, it does not call the destroy-method automatically when the application context is closed.

You need to explicitly call the destroy() method or manage the cleanup manually.

| Scope           | Description                      | Instance per     | Available In   |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------- | -------------- |
| **singleton**   | One shared instance              | Spring container | All            |
| **prototype**   | New instance each time           | Request          | All            |
| **request**     | One per HTTP request             | Request          | Web only       |
| **session**     | One per HTTP session             | Session          | Web only       |
| **application** | One per web app (ServletContext) | Application      | Web only       |
| **websocket**   | One per WebSocket session        | WebSocket        | WebSocket apps |


Bean Lifecycle:
================

C:\Users\tejas\Desktop\springboot repo\SBMS-39-main\05-Bean-Scopes:

Flow of Execution
------------------
ex : 	<bean id="eng" class="in.ashokit.Engine" 
				   init-method="start" 
				   destroy-method="stop"/>


Observation:  
------------

- we require some method to execute automatically after beans creation for that
  we specify that method name inside init-method tag 

- also before destroying the bean we want to perform some clean up / any method we
  want to execute before destroying we must specify that method name
  inside destroy-method tag.

Q. What if we want to execute two methods at start ?

inside beans :  init-method="initAll"

use that method to call others :

public void initAll() {
    start();
    loadSettings();
    prepareEngine();
}

============
Assignment
============

-> Develop Java application using Spring framework
Read book data from keyboard and insert into db table using spring-jdbc.			  

===========
Autowiring
===========

Incorrect Setter Method Name (setPrinter):   <-- byName    < 1 Note : Only for by Name 
==========================================

autowire="byName" works by matching the bean ID with the setter method name.
The bean id in XML is sony, but the setter method is setPrinter(IPrinter xyz).
Spring looks for setSony(IPrinter xyz), not setPrinter(IPrinter xyz).It noting to do with field variable like xyz.
It only looks for setter method name having matching bean name ex "setBEANID".

✅ Fix: Rename the setter method to match the bean id  name:

public void setSony(IPrinter xyz) {  // Must match field name
    System.out.println("ATM:: setSony() method called");
    this.sony = xyz;
}
This allows Spring to inject the sony bean properly. 

#Does autowire ="byType" Use Only Setter Injection ?
==================================================

No, autowire= "byType" prefers setter injection but can use constructor injection if explicitly defined with @Autowired.{not while using xml based configuration}

-> Although it use setter method but does not required naming convention as byName autowiring     < 2  Imp Note (ref 1)

-> We can perform dependency injection in 2 ways

		1) Manual Wiring
		2) Auto wiring

=> Manual wiring means programmer will inform to IOC which is dependent obj using ref attribute like below

	<bean id="pp" class="in.ashokit.PaymentProcessor">
		<property name="payment" ref="debit" />
	</bean>


=> Auto wiring means IOC will identify dependent object and it will perform DI.

=> In spring xml approach, by default auto wiring is disabled*.(we explicitly write autowire in xml file.)

ex 1] <bean id="employee" class="com.example.Employee">
           <!-- No autowire set; autowiring is disabled by default -->
      </bean>

If you want to enable autowiring in XML, you need to do something like:

ex 2] xml

	<bean id="employee" class="com.example.Employee" autowire="byName"/>



=> Autowiring having 4 modes

				1) byName  ----> method name is important 
				2) byType

				//the above both modes use setter injection				<-- imp

				3) constructor

				4) no (default) // dependency injection will not going to happen 
========
byName
========
Based on the setter method name, the IoC container identifies the dependent bean and injects it.
The property name derived from the setter method must match the bean id.
If no bean id matches the property name, then dependency injection will NOT happen.
Every bean must have a unique id, otherwise the XML is invalid.

Example:
<bean id="payment" class="in.ashokit.CreditCardPayment" />
<bean id="db" class="in.ashokit.DebitCardPayment" />

<bean id="pp" class="in.ashokit.PaymentProcessor" autowire="byName" />

For this to work:
The PaymentProcessor class must have a setter like:

public void setPayment(Payment p) { ... }


Because:

setPayment() → property name = payment

This matches:
bean id="payment"

So DI succeeds.

========
byType
========

-> Based on data type of variable IOC will identify dependent object.

-> If variable data type is interface then it will check interface implemented beans.

-> If we have more than one bean which are implementing interface then IOC will get confused to take decision. Then we will get ambiguity problem.

-> We can resolve ambiguity problem in 2 ways

			1) autowire-candidate = false

			2) primary = true		

=============
constructor
=============

Note: When we go for byName or byType then IOC will perform Setter Injection with auto wiring.

-> If we want to perform Constructor Injection with Autowiring then we should configure autowire="constructor".

Note : autowire=constructor will use byType mechanism to identify dependent object.	

=====
no
=====

=> The autowire ="no" option is used to disable autowiring explicitly for a bean

======================
Collection Injection
======================

	private Integer id;

============
Spring Boot
============

-> Spring Boot is an approach to develop spring based applications with less configuration.

-> Spring Boot is an extension for Spring Framework.

-> What type of apps we can develop using spring same type of apps we can develop using spring boot also.

Note: Spring boot internally using spring framework.

-> Spring Boot supports rapid application development.

=============================
Advantages with Spring Boot
============================

1) POM Starters (Simplied Maven dependencies)

	Ex : spring-boot-starter
	     spring-boot-starter-web
	     spring-boot-starter-data-jpa
	     spring-boot-starter-mail
	     spring-boot-starter-security

2) Dependency Version Conflict Solution

3) Auto Configuration

	Ex: if we add data-jpa starter, it will create cpool

	    when we run boot app, it will start IOC container

	    if we add web starter, it will deploy our app in server

	    If we add security starter, it will provide login page


4) Embedded Servers : It will provide server to run our app 

	Ex:  Tomcat, jetty, netty


5) Actuators : To monitor our application 
               (production ready features )



#####  spring boot = (spring + auto config ) - xml

===========
STS setup 
===========


Step-1 : download sts jar file using below link

https://cdn.spring.io/spring-tools/release/STS4/4.20.1.RELEASE/dist/e4.29/spring-tool-suite-4-4.20.1.RELEASE-e4.29.0-win32.win32.x86_64.self-extracting.jar

Step-2 : Run jar file using cmd

		$ java -jar <jar-name>


Step-3 : Open STS.exe file		

================================
Create Spring Boot Application
===============================

1) start.spring.io  (spring initiazr)

2) STS IDE


======================================
What is start class in spring boot ?
======================================

-> Start class is entry point for spring boot application

-> Start class is also called as main class in spring boot.


===========================================
How IOC will be starting in spring boot ?
============================================

=> In spring boot run ( ) method will start IOC container based on pom starter.

=> run ( ) method will return ioc obj


=> If we add spring-boot-starter then it will use below class to start IOC

Class Name : AnnotationConfigApplicationContext


=> If we add spring-boot-starter-web then it will use below class to start IOC

Class Name : AnnotationConfigServletWebServerApplicationContext

=> If we add spring-boot-starter-webflux then it will use below class to start IOC

Class Name : AnnotationConfigReactiveWebServerApplicationContext


==================================
What is @SpringBootApplication ?
==================================

@SpringBootConfiguration : Represents java class as config class
@EnableAutoConfiguration : To load auto configure classes
@ComponentScan           : To identify spring beans available in the project



==============================================
How to represent java class as Spring Bean ?
==============================================

<bean id="udao" class="in.ashokit.UserDao" scope="prototype"/>


@Component
class UserDao{
	

}

==============================================
How component scanning will work internally ?
==============================================

=> Component scan will work based on base package

=> start class pkg is called as base package

=> boot will scan base package and its sub packages

Note : The pkg name which is starting with base pkg name is called as sub package of base package.



in.ashokit
    - Application.java
    - UserDao.java
    - ReportDao.java

in.ashokit.service

in.ashokit.security

in.ashokit.util    

com.tcs
    - UserService.java    


    in.ashokit

    com.tcs


=> We can configure more than one base package also

@SpringBootApplication
@ComponentScan(basePackages = {"in.ashokit", "com.tcs"})
public class Application {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		ConfigurableApplicationContext context =
				SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
		
		int count = context.getBeanDefinitionCount();
		
		System.out.println(count);
	}
}    

==============================
What is @Bean annotation ?
=============================


=> To customize bean obj creation we will write a method with @Bean annotation like below...


@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
	
	public AppConfig() {
		System.out.println("AppConfig :: Constructor");
	}

	@Bean
	public AppSecurity createSecurityObj() {
		AppSecurity as = new AppSecurity("SHA-256");
		return as;
	}
}


=> In project we will customize bean objects for below scenarios

	 - Security Customization

	 - Data Source Customization

	 - Kafka customization

	 - Redis customization

	 - Swagger Customization




@Component

@Scope

@Configuration

@Bean

@ComponentScan


============
Autowiring
=============

@Autowired annotation 


=> We can use this annotation at 3 places

1) setter method level

2) constructor level

3) field level



@Component
public class UserService {

	@Autowired
	private UserDao dao; // field injection (reflection)

	public void getUsername(Integer id) {
		System.out.println("dependent :: "+ dao.getClass().getName());
		String name = dao.findNameById(id);
		System.out.println(name);
	}
}


1) setter method

2) Constructor

3) Field

@Autowired




package in.ashokit.service;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

import in.ashokit.dao.IUserDao;

@Component
public class UserService {

	private PwdService pwdService;

	private IUserDao userDao;

	private EmailService emailService;

	@Autowired
	public void setPwdService(PwdService pwdService) {
		this.pwdService = pwdService;
	}

	@Autowired
	public void setUserDao(IUserDao userDao) {
		this.userDao = userDao;
	}

	@Autowired
	public void setEmailService(EmailService emailService) {
		this.emailService = emailService;
	}

	public void registerUser(String name, String email, String pwd) {

		// encrypt pwd
		String encryptPwd = pwdService.encryptPwd(pwd);

		// save user in db
		boolean isSaved = userDao.saveUser(name, email, encryptPwd);

		// send email
		if (isSaved) {
			boolean isSent = emailService.sendEmail(email, "Test Subject", "Test Body");
			if (isSent) {
				System.out.println("User Registration Completed...");
			}
		}
	}

}
========================================================

@Service
public class UserService {

	@Autowired
	private PwdService pwdService;

	@Autowired
	private IUserDao userDao;

	@Autowired
	private EmailService emailService;

	public void registerUser(String name, String email, String pwd) {

		// encrypt pwd
		String encryptPwd = pwdService.encryptPwd(pwd);

		// save user in db
		boolean isSaved = userDao.saveUser(name, email, encryptPwd);

		// send email
		if (isSaved) {
			boolean isSent = emailService.sendEmail(email, "Test Subject", "Test Body");
			if (isSent) {
				System.out.println("User Registration Completed...");
			}
		}
	}

}

========================================================

@Component
@Scope
@Configuration
@Bean (method level annotation)
@Autowired
@Qualifier
@Primary


@Component

@Service : Will be used at business / service layer

@Repository : Will be used in DAO layer

@Controller ====> spring web mvc + c 2 b

@RestController ==> spring web mvc + b 2 b (rest api)


===========================================
Q) @Component vs @Service  vs @Repository
===========================================
